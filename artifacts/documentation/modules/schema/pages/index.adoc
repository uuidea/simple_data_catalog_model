For symmetrical, transposed three phase lines, it is sufficient to use attributes of the line segment, which describe impedances and admittances for the entire length of the segment.  Additionally impedances can be computed by using length and associated per length impedances.
The BaseVoltage at the two ends of ACLineSegments in a Line shall have the same BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage. However, boundary lines may have slightly different BaseVoltage.nominalVoltages and variation is allowed. Larger voltage difference in general requires use of an equivalent branch.+++

| xref::class/Disconnector.adoc[`Disconnector`]
| +++A manually operated or motor operated mechanical switching device used for changing the connections in a circuit, or for isolating a circuit or equipment from a source of power. It is required to open or close circuits when negligible current is broken or made.+++

| xref::class/EarthFaultCompensator.adoc[`EarthFaultCompensator`]
| +++A conducting equipment used to represent a connection to ground which is typically used to compensate earth faults.   An earth fault compensator device modelled with a single terminal implies a second terminal solidly connected to ground.  If two terminals are modelled, the ground is not assumed and normal connection rules apply.+++

| xref::class/LoadResponseCharacteristic.adoc[`LoadResponseCharacteristic`]
| +++Models the characteristic response of the load demand due to changes in system conditions such as voltage and frequency. It is not related to demand response.
If LoadResponseCharacteristic.exponentModel is True, the exponential voltage or frequency dependent models are specified and used as to calculate active and reactive power components of the load model.
The equations to calculate active and reactive power components of the load model are internal to the power flow calculation, hence they use different quantities depending on the use case of the data exchange. 
The equations for exponential voltage dependent load model injected power are: 
pInjection= Pnominal* (Voltage/cim:BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage) ** cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.pVoltageExponent
qInjection= Qnominal* (Voltage/cim:BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage) ** cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.qVoltageExponent
Where: 
1) * means "multiply" and ** is "raised to power of";
2) Pnominal and Qnominal represent the active power and reactive power at nominal voltage as any load described by the voltage exponential model shall be given at nominal voltage.  This means that EnergyConsumer.p and EnergyConsumer.q  are at nominal voltage.
3) After power flow is solved: 
-pInjection and qInjection correspond to SvPowerflow.p and SvPowerflow.q respectively.  
- Voltage corresponds to SvVoltage.v at the TopologicalNode where the load is connected.+++

| xref::class/NonConformLoad.adoc[`NonConformLoad`]

| xref::class/PowerSystemResource.adoc[`PowerSystemResource`]
| +++A power system resource (PSR) can be an item of equipment such as a switch, an equipment container containing many individual items of equipment such as a substation, or an organisational entity such as sub-control area. Power system resources can have measurements associated.+++

| xref::class/PowerTransformer.adoc[`PowerTransformer`]
| +++An electrical device consisting of  two or more coupled windings, with or without a magnetic core, for introducing mutual coupling between electric circuits. Transformers can be used to control voltage and phase shift (active power flow).
A power transformer may be composed of separate transformer tanks that need not be identical.
A power transformer can be modelled with or without tanks and is intended for use in both balanced and unbalanced representations.   A power transformer typically has two terminals, but may have one (grounding), three or more terminals.
The inherited association ConductingEquipment.BaseVoltage should not be used.  The association from TransformerEnd to BaseVoltage should be used instead.+++

| xref::class/PowerTransformerEnd.adoc[`PowerTransformerEnd`]
| +++A PowerTransformerEnd is associated with each Terminal of a PowerTransformer.
The impedance values r, r0, x, and x0 of a PowerTransformerEnd represents a star equivalent as follows.
1) for a two Terminal PowerTransformer the high voltage (TransformerEnd.endNumber=1) PowerTransformerEnd has non zero values on r, r0, x, and x0 while the low voltage (TransformerEnd.endNumber=2) PowerTransformerEnd has zero values for r, r0, x, and x0.  Parameters are always provided, even if the PowerTransformerEnds have the same rated voltage.  In this case, the parameters are provided at the PowerTransformerEnd which has TransformerEnd.endNumber equal to 1.
2) for a three Terminal PowerTransformer the three PowerTransformerEnds represent a star equivalent with each leg in the star represented by r, r0, x, and x0 values.
3) For a three Terminal transformer each PowerTransformerEnd shall have g, g0, b and b0 values corresponding to the no load losses distributed on the three PowerTransformerEnds. The total no load loss shunt impedances may also be placed at one of the PowerTransformerEnds, preferably the end numbered 1, having the shunt values on end 1.  This is the preferred way.
4) for a PowerTransformer with more than three Terminals the PowerTransformerEnd impedance values cannot be used. Instead use the TransformerMeshImpedance or split the transformer into multiple PowerTransformers.
Each PowerTransformerEnd must be contained by a PowerTransformer. Because a PowerTransformerEnd (or any other object) can not be contained by more than one parent, a PowerTransformerEnd can not have an association to an EquipmentContainer (Substation, VoltageLevel, etc).+++

| xref::class/PowerTransformerInfo.adoc[`PowerTransformerInfo`]
| +++Set of power transformer data, from an equipment library.+++

| xref::class/ProtectedSwitch.adoc[`ProtectedSwitch`]
| +++A ProtectedSwitch is a switching device that can be operated by ProtectionEquipment.+++

| xref::class/PSRType.adoc[`PSRType`]
| +++lassifying instances of the same class, e.g. overhead and underground ACLineSegments. This classification mechanism is intended to provide flexibility outside the scope of this document, i.e. provide customisation that is non standard.+++

| xref::class/RatioTapChanger.adoc[`RatioTapChanger`]
| +++A tap changer that changes the voltage ratio impacting the voltage magnitude but not the phase angle across the transformer.

Angle sign convention (general): Positive value indicates a positive phase shift from the winding where the tap is located to the other winding (for a two-winding transformer).+++

| xref::class/RegularIntervalSchedule.adoc[`RegularIntervalSchedule`]
| +++The schedule has time points where the time between them is constant.+++

| xref::class/RegularTimePoint.adoc[`RegularTimePoint`]
| +++Time point for a schedule where the time between the consecutive points is constant.+++

| xref::class/RegulatingControl.adoc[`RegulatingControl`]
| +++Specifies a set of equipment that works together to control a power system quantity such as voltage or flow. 
Remote bus voltage control is possible by specifying the controlled terminal located at some place remote from the controlling equipment.
The specified terminal shall be associated with the connectivity node of the controlled point.  The most specific subtype of RegulatingControl shall be used in case such equipment participate in the control, e.g. TapChangerControl for tap changers.
For flow control, load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a TopologicalNode (bus) into the conducting equipment.
The attribute minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue are required in the following cases:
- For a power generating module operated in power factor control mode to specify maximum and minimum power factor values;
- Whenever it is necessary to have an off center target voltage for the tap changer regulator. For instance, due to long cables to off shore wind farms and the need to have a simpler setup at the off shore transformer platform, the voltage is controlled from the land at the connection point for the off shore wind farm. Since there usually is a voltage rise along the cable, there is typical and overvoltage of up 3-4 kV compared to the on shore station. Thus in normal operation the tap changer on the on shore station is operated with a target set point, which is in the lower parts of the dead band.
The attributes minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue are not related to the attribute targetDeadband and thus they are not treated as an alternative of the targetDeadband. They are needed due to limitations in the local substation controller. The attribute targetDeadband is used to prevent the power flow from move the tap position in circles (hunting) that is to be used regardless of the attributes minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue.+++

| xref::class/SeasonDayTypeSchedule.adoc[`SeasonDayTypeSchedule`]
| +++A time schedule covering a 24 hour period, with curve data for a specific type of season and day.+++

| +++A Series Compensator is a series capacitor or reactor or an AC transmission line without charging susceptance.  It is a two terminal device.+++

| xref::class/Substation.adoc[`Substation`]
| +++A collection of equipment for purposes other than generation or utilization, through which electric energy in bulk is passed for the purposes of switching or modifying its characteristics.+++

| xref::class/Switch.adoc[`Switch`]
| +++A generic device designed to close, or open, or both, one or more electric circuits.  All switches are two terminal devices including grounding switches. The ACDCTerminal.connected at the two sides of the switch shall not be considered for assessing switch connectivity, i.e. only Switch.open, .normalOpen and .locked are relevant.+++

| xref::class/SwitchInfo.adoc[`SwitchInfo`]
| +++Switch datasheet information.+++

| xref::class/TapChanger.adoc[`TapChanger`]

| xref::class/Terminal.adoc[`Terminal`]
| +++An AC electrical connection point to a piece of conducting equipment. Terminals are connected at physical connection points called connectivity nodes.+++

| xref::class/TransformerEnd.adoc[`TransformerEnd`]
| +++A conducting connection point of a power transformer. It corresponds to a physical transformer winding terminal.  In earlier CIM versions, the TransformerWinding class served a similar purpose, but this class is more flexible because it associates to terminal but is not a specialization of ConductingEquipment.+++

| xref::class/UseagePoint.adoc[`UseagePoint`]
| +++Logical or physical point in the network to which readings or events may be attributed. Used at the place where a physical or virtual meter may be located; however, it is not required that a meter be present.+++

| xref::class/VoltageLevel.adoc[`VoltageLevel`]
| +++A collection of equipment at one common system voltage forming a switchgear. The equipment typically consists of breakers, busbars, instrumentation, control, regulation and protection devices as well as assemblies of all these.+++

| xref::class/WireInfo.adoc[`WireInfo`]
| +++Wire data that can be specified per line segment phase, or for the line segment as a whole in case its phases all have the same wire characteristics.+++
