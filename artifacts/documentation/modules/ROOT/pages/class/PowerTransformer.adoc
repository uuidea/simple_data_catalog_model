= `PowerTransformer`
:toclevels: 4


+++An electrical device consisting of  two or more coupled windings, with or without a magnetic core, for introducing mutual coupling between electric circuits. Transformers can be used to control voltage and phase shift (active power flow).
A power transformer may be composed of separate transformer tanks that need not be identical.
A power transformer can be modelled with or without tanks and is intended for use in both balanced and unbalanced representations.   A power transformer typically has two terminals, but may have one (grounding), three or more terminals.
The inherited association ConductingEquipment.BaseVoltage should not be used.  The association from TransformerEnd to BaseVoltage should be used instead.+++

//[discrete]
[#aggregate]
=== `aggregate`
+++The aggregate flag provides an alternative way of representing an aggregated (equivalent) element. It is applicable in cases when the dedicated classes for equivalent equipment do not have all of the attributes necessary to represent the required level of detail.  In case the flag is set to “true” the single instance of equipment represents multiple pieces of equipment that have been modelled together as an aggregate equivalent obtained by a network reduction procedure. Examples would be power transformers or synchronous machines operating in parallel modelled as a single aggregate power transformer or aggregate synchronous machine.  
The attribute is not used for EquivalentBranch, EquivalentShunt and EquivalentInjection.+++
